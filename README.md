A package to open files related to my research.

This package reads 4 types of files:

**Academic article metadata from the Web of Science that have been exported as Win UTF 8 Tab Delimited format.**
  After performing a search in the WOS, save it by clicking on "Save to other file formats" in the dropdown menu.
  
**Patent metadata from Thomson Innovation.**
  Export the results as .CSV files.
  
**Analysis files from Fukan System.**

**Other data sets that comply the following:**
* Have a header
* All contents can be used as text




*This is no other thing that the same read functions in R (readtable, fread) with the parameters adjusted for the type of files I constantly use.*
